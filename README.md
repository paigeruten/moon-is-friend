# The Moon is our Friend

An arcade game for [Playdate](https://play.date/) made in one weekend, for [PlayJam 7](https://itch.io/jam/playjam-7).

## Story

> After a large-scale asteroid mining expedition gone wrong, the Earth is now under a barrage of asteroids and is very scared. Desparate to help its best friend, the Moon has woken up from its deep slumber and is free to move around in its orbit to deflect the incoming asteroids with its gravitational pull.
>
> Control the Moon with the crank to pull incoming asteroids away from the Earth, but don't let the asteroids hit the Moon either!
>
> Sometimes Earth will send up a rocket full of supplies--make sure to catch it as it zooms by! It could contain extra health, a shield, or give you special abilities.
