> #### 2038: The Moon Wakes Up
>
> After a large-scale asteroid mining expedition gone wrong, the Earth is now under a barrage of asteroids, and is very scared.
>
> Desperate to help its best friend, the Moon wakes up from its deep slumber and springs into action to protect the Earth.
>
> #### How to play
>
> Use the crank to control the Moon and pull incoming asteroids away from the Earth. Get **+1 point** per asteroid averted, and **+5 points** for getting two asteroids to collide with each other!
>
> Try to grab any supplies the Earth sends your way - they may contain extra health or various powerups.
>
> If you get **100 points**, you get a little gold star on the title screen. Good luck!
