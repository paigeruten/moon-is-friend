*After a large-scale asteroid mining expedition gone wrong, the Earth is now under a barrage of meteors, and is very scared.*

*You are the Moon, and must help your best friend the Earth by moving around in your orbit and diverting meteors away with your gravitational pull!*

There are multiple ways to play this arcade-style game, all featuring crank-based action and satisfying 50fps planetary physics:

    - **3 difficulty levels:** For an optional extra challenge, earn badges for completing missions on **Hard** or **One Heart** (die in one hit) difficulty.
- **Endless mode:** See how long you can survive as more and more meteors spawn, and try to get on the global scoreboards!
- **Zen mode:** Meteors can't hurt you, just fling meteors around and enjoy the space physics.
